Ingredients
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
extra virgin olive oil
kosher salt , to taste
freshly ground black pepper , to taste
1/2 cup of your favorite BBQ sauce

Instructions
Prepare the grill for direct cooking at high heat (450°F). Brush the cooking grates clean.

Drizzle the chicken breasts with extra virgin olive oil and rub over the breasts. Season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.

Place the chicken breasts on the hot grill. Cover and cook for 5-6 minutes or until they easily release from the grates. Flip the chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes longer. Baste the chicken breasts with BBQ sauce, flip and cook for 2 minutes on each side. Repeat on the other side. Cook until the breasts are firm to the touch and opaque all the way through, registering 160°F internal temp (the temp will rise to 165°F as the chicken rests).

Transfer to a plate and cover with a piece of aluminum foil and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve with more BBQ sauce if desired.
